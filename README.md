# Natanael Javier

## Cloud & Full-Stack Engineer

I design and build secure, scalable applications and cloud infrastructure.

Originally on the path to medicine, I discovered something equally powerful — building systems that scale through code. Today, I focus on combining software engineering with cloud security to create reliable and hardened production environments.
